   distribution.

 * Change order of entries in CHANGES file (this file) to have newest entries
   at the top.

 * Avoid barewords in Makefile.PL.

 * "NAME" field in Makefile.PL must be a package name, so change "Math-Roman"
   into "Math::Roman".

 * Remove Math::BigFloat from the "PREREQ_PM" field in Makefile.PL, since
   Math::BigFloat is not used.

 * Required version of Math::BigInt is 1.35, not 1.70, so update Makefile.PL.

 * Trim whitespace. This makes 'podchecker' happy.

 * Fix POD formatting issues.

 * Add more references to CPAN in the POD.
